# Dark Gift of Fekre, Queen of Poxes
*Charm*  

Fekre's gift is the power of spreading disease. This dark gift allows its beneficiary to cast the [contagion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/contagion-xphb.md) spell as an action. After it has been used three times, the dark gift vanishes.

The beneficiary of this dark gift reeks of filth.
