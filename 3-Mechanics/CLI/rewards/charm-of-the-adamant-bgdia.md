# Charm of the Adamant

This charm has 9 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge from the charm to gain 30 temporary hit points. For the next hour, your eyes become voids of utter darkness, and you can't be [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened). Once all its charges have been expended, the charm vanishes from you.
