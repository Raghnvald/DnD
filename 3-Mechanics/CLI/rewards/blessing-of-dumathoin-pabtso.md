# Blessing of Dumathoin

Your eyes become keen enough to pick out hidden secrets. You gain [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/senses.md#Darkvision). If you already had [darkvision](/3-Mechanics/CLI/senses.md#Darkvision), you can see in color in the dark. In addition, you can use an action to gain [truesight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/senses.md#Truesight) for 1 minute. Once you gain [truesight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/senses.md#Truesight) in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
