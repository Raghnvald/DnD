## Traits

**Crushing Wheels.** The Tormentor can move through the space of any Medium or smaller creature. When it does, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone).If the creature was already [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone), it takes an extra 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage.This trait can't be used against a particular creature more than once each turn.

**Magic Weapons.** The Tormentor's weapon attacks are magical.

**Prone Deficiency.** If the Tormentor rolls over and falls [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone), it can't right itself and is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated) until flipped upright.

**Raking Scythes.** When the Tormentor moves within 5 feet of a creature that isn't [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone) or another vehicle for the first time on a turn, it can rake the creature or vehicle with its protruding blades for 13 (2d10 + 2) slashing damage. A creature moves out of the way and takes no damage if it succeeds on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.A vehicle moves out of the way and takes no damage if its driver succeeds on the saving throw.

## Action Stations

**Harpoon Flinger (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Half Cover).** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage.
