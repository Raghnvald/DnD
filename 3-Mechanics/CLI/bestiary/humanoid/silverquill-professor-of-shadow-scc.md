# [Silverquill Professor of Shadow](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/silverquill-professor-of-shadow-scc.md)
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 215*  

Professors of shadow wield the linguistic magic of Silverquill College through slicing wit and debilitating inky shadow. Whether weaving their magic through spoken incantations and scathing insults or through shadows, these teachers break down the resolve of their foes.

The professors strive to carry themselves as immaculately as possible, seeking to overawe and wrong-foot anyone who would stand against them in debate or in battle. In teaching their students, professors of shadow focus on words that find the tiniest, most invisible cracks in an opponent's defenses and break them.

## Silverquill Scholars

The scholars of Silverquill College study the power of magic shaped through spoken and written words. They use that power either to illuminate and guide or to obscure and demoralize.
