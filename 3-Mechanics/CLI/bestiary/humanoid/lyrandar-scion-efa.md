# [Lyrandar Scion](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/lyrandar-scion-efa.md)
*Source: Eberron: Forge of the Artificer p. 82*  

The Khoravar dragonmarked scions of House Lyrandar include swashbuckling sky captains, seafaring adventurers, and sinister cultists of the Hurricane Harvest. The power of their dragonmarks manifests as easy control of wind, thunder, and lightning, which they wield as readily in combat as in navigating the sea and sky.

Members of the Hurricane Harvest believe that the Mark of Storm is not a gift of the Sovereign Host, as others in their house teach, but the sign of the Devourer. They maintain that the greatest ancestors of their house live on as krakens in the deep and guide the cult through visions to use their power for destruction and domination. They sometimes partner with kuo-toa, sahuagin, and other monsters of the deep.
