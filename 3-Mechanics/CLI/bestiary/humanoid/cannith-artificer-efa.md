# [Cannith Artificer](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/cannith-artificer-efa.md)
*Source: Eberron: Forge of the Artificer p. 80*  

Dragonmarked artificers of House Cannith (typically human) often wield compact devices similar to eldritch cannons that can produce a variety of devastating effects. Both these cannons and the artificers' force-empowered maces function only in their creator's hands.
