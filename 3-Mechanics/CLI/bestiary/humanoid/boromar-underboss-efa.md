# [Boromar Underboss](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/boromar-underboss-efa.md)
*Source: Eberron: Forge of the Artificer p. 57*  

Underbosses supervise larger clan operations, such as gambling halls and warehouses of smuggled goods awaiting transport. Accustomed to the criminal lifestyle, these hardy individuals (mostly halflings) dismiss and dispose of threats with calculated ease.
