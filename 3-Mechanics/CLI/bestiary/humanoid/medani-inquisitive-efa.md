The most prized inquisitives of House Medani, a house of mostly Khoravar, employ their dragonmarks and their keen intellects to anticipate threats from any quarter. Some are part of a secretive order called the Basilisk's Gaze, dedicated to hunting down fugitive war criminals who committed atrocities during the Last War.
