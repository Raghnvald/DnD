# [Sentinel Marshal](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/sentinel-marshal-efa.md)
*Source: Eberron: Forge of the Artificer p. 83*  

The Sentinel Marshals of House Deneith, who are typically human, hold the honor of the house in their hands. The Treaty of Thronehold upheld their authority to pursue criminals across international borders, giving them the unique privilege and responsibility of upholding the law across Khorvaire.

Only the most trusted heirs of the house are honored with a position in the Sentinel Marshals, either after serving in the house's other guilds for several years (as bodyguards in the Defenders Guild and mercenary officers in the Blademarks Guild) or by special dispensation of House Deneith.

Sentinel Marshals are never authorized to break local or international laws, but neither are they accountable to the legal authorities of any nation. A rogue marshal can be punished only by the leadership of House Deneith, but some nations (such as Darguun and Droaam) ignore these conventions.
