# Bronze Dragon

## Regional Effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an adult or ancient bronze dragon's lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Buoying Currents.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair that lack a [Swim Speed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb.md) ignore the extra cost of movement while swimming.  
- **Sun and Storms.** While in its lair, the dragon can cast [Control Weather](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/control-weather-xphb.md), requiring no Material components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action. When casting the spell this way, the dragon can control the weather within 1 mile of its lair, regardless if the dragon is inside or outside.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
