# [Xandala](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/xandala-toa.md)
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 236*  

The half-elf sorcerer Xandala has come to Chult in search of the Ring of Winter, an artifact in Artus Cimber's possession. Xandala knows that the ring has kept Artus alive for over a century, and she craves its power. If she meets the characters, Xandala pretends to be Artus's daughter and tries to convince them to help her find him. Her plan is to cast [dominate person](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dominate-person-xphb.md) on Artus and force him to give her the ring, then escape using her [fly](3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fly-xphb.md) spell.

Xandala's magic traces back to a draconic bloodline, and parts of her skin are covered by a thin sheen of protective scales. She has befriended a pseudodragon named Summerwise, who thinks that Xandala's quest for the ring is dangerous but has given up trying to talk the sorcerer out of it. Summerwise can be turned against Xandala by good-aligned characters.
