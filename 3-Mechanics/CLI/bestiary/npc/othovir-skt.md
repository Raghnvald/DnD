# [Othovir](3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/othovir-skt.md)
*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 255*  

Othovir is a gifted harness-maker who doesn't talk about his family or where he came from. He cares about his business, his clients, and his good name.

Ideal:"Find what you do well, and do it to the best of your ability."

Bond:"I won't allow my name to be tarnished."

Flaw:"I get angry when others pry into my private life."
