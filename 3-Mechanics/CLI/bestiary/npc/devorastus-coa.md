  - "desc": "Devorastus takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space,\
      \ but a creature that does so is subjected to Engulf and has disadvantage on\
      \ the saving throw. Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total cover.\
      \ A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a creature\
      \ or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful DC 21 Strength check,\
      \ and the creature making the attempt takes 35 (10d6) acid damage. The cube\

      \ (Perception) check to spot Devorastus if it has neither moved nor attacked.\
      \ A creature that tries to enter Devorastus' space while unaware of Devorastus\

      \ 28 (8d6) acid damage. A target hit by this attack must make a DC 21 Constitution\
      \ saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the prone condition."
    "name": "Spit"
  - "desc": "Devorastus moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large\
      \ or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever Devorastus enters a creature's space,\
      \ the creature must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save,\
      \ the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of Devorastus.\
      \ A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed\
      \ saving throw. On a failed save, Devorastus enters the creature's space, the\
      \ creature takes 35 (10d6) acid damage, and is engulfed. The engulfed creature\
      \ can't breathe, has the restrained condition, and takes 42 (12d6) acid damage\
      \ at the start of each of Devorastus' turns. When Devorastus moves, the engulfed\
      \ creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by making a\
      \ DC 21 Strength check as an action. On a success, the creature escapes and\
      \ enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of Devorastus."
