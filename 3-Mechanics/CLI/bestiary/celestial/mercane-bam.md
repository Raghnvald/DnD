Mercanes are the mysterious, magical creations of one or more deities whose portfolios revolve around fair commerce. Standing 12 feet tall, they are lanky blue beings who dress in elegant robes and have elongated heads and long, spindly fingers.

Mercanes conduct most of their business in Wildspace and the Astral Sea. To a mercane, commerce can take many forms, from the trading of goods and services to the trading of ideas and information. Mercanes are best known, however, for procuring and selling magic items, including artifacts and spelljamming helms. It's rare to see more than one mercane at a time, though it's common for a mercane to be accompanied by underlings or bodyguards.

Mercanes will conduct business with anyone, fairly and reliably, provided the other party has neither harmed nor swindled another mercane in the past. Mercanes have a special form of telepathy that enables them to communicate with one another across the multiverse. A mercane often uses this ability to warn another mercanes about individuals who are dangerous or unreliable. Once a mercane has been offended by someone, getting back into their good graces is next to impossible.
