**Adult White Dragon Connections**

| dice: d8 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A pirate captain uses the pervasive fog near an [adult white dragon's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-white-dragon-xmm.md) lair to elude capture and propitiates the dragon with a share of the crew's booty. |
| 2 | A [djinni](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/djinni-xmm.md) has pledged to serve an [adult white dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-white-dragon-xmm.md) for a year and a day in exchange for sparing the genie's previous master's life. |
| 3 | An [arcanaloth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/arcanaloth-xmm.md) has been trying to tease information out of an [adult white dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-white-dragon-xmm.md), hoping the dragon can lead it to a lost font of magical power. |
| 4 | An [adult white dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-white-dragon-xmm.md), captured by devils decades ago, now serves as a mount for an [ice devil](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/ice-devil-xmm.md). |
| 5 | A [beholder](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/beholder-xmm.md) manipulates an [adult white dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-white-dragon-xmm.md) into eliminating its enemies by inventing ways in which these foes have supposedly offended the dragon. |
| 6 | A [storm giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/storm-giant-xmm.md) and an [adult white dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-white-dragon-xmm.md) are engaged in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse, leaving a trail of destruction behind them. |
| 7 | An [adult white dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-white-dragon-xmm.md) periodically brings a mouthful of gems to the [ancient crystal dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-crystal-dragon-ftd.md) who raised them, and who is now too old and tired to seek out new mineral veins for sustenance. |
| 8 | A clan of [winged kobolds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/winged-kobold-xmm.md) treat the air currents and ice slides of an [adult white dragon's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-white-dragon-xmm.md) lair as an obstacle course. The dragon enjoys devising increasingly hazardous routes for the kobolds to tackle. |
