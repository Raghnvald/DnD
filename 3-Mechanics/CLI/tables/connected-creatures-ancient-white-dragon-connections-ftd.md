**Ancient White Dragon Connections**

| dice: d4 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A [death knight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/death-knight-xmm.md) and an [ancient white dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-white-dragon-xmm.md) swap tales of old foes and unanswered grievances, nursing the hunger for vengeance that sustains them. |
| 2 | An [ancient white dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-white-dragon-xmm.md) makes intermittent assaults against a mated pair of [adult silver dragons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-silver-dragon-xmm.md) who lair nearby. |
| 3 | An [ancient white dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-white-dragon-xmm.md) guards a [lich's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/lich-xmm.md) phylactery, keeping it sealed in a tomb of ice. The lich visits periodically, bearing fabulous treasures as payment. |
| 4 | A community of orcs believe an [ancient white dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/ancient-white-dragon-xmm.md) to be the reincarnation of a legendary leader. They've been venerating the dragon so long that the dragon now believes the story and speaks proudly in Orc about the orcs' triumphs. |
