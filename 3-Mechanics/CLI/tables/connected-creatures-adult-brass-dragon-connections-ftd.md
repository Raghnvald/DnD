**Adult Brass Dragon Connections**

| dice: d8 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | An [adult brass dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-brass-dragon-xmm.md) enjoys trading riddles with a [gynosphinx](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/sphinx-of-lore-xmm.md). |
| 2 | Long ago, an [adult brass dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-brass-dragon-xmm.md) swore service to a human priest, expecting to outlive the priest. But now the priest is a [mummy lord](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/mummy-lord-xmm.md), and the dragon remains bound to serve. |
| 3 | An [efreeti](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/efreeti-xmm.md) wants to claim an [adult brass dragon's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-brass-dragon-xmm.md) palatial lair and fabulous hoard. |
| 4 | A pair of [rocs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/roc-xmm.md) have nested too close to an [adult brass dragon's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-brass-dragon-xmm.md) lair, and they harass the dragon whenever they can. |
| 5 | A [guardian naga](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/guardian-naga-xmm.md) charged with protecting an ancient artifact has decided that the artifact—as well as the naga—would be safer in an [adult brass dragon's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-brass-dragon-xmm.md) hoard than left alone in some crumbling ruin. |
| 6 | A half-brass dragon [yuan-ti abomination](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/yuan-ti-abomination-xmm.md) leads other yuan-ti in worshiping an [adult brass dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-brass-dragon-xmm.md) as a serpent god, much to the dragon's amusement. |
| 7 | Two [adult brass dragons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-brass-dragon-xmm.md) are rearing a clutch of wyrmlings together, and they allow the infant dragons to wreak innocent havoc on nearby settlements. |
| 8 | A solitary [adult brass dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-brass-dragon-xmm.md) has adopted a [blue dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/blue-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) found starving in the desert. |
