| dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A [specter](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/specter-xmm.md) is bound as the guardian of a [young red dragon's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon-xmm.md) treasure hoard. |
| 2 | A [young red dragon's](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon-xmm.md) new lair spawns [magma mephits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/magma-mephit-xmm.md) and [smoke mephits](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/smoke-mephit-xmm.md), which escape into the surrounding countryside and cause mischief. |
| 3 | A [young red dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon-xmm.md) serves as the guardian of a githyanki creche, hoping to eventually earn the allegiance of the young githyanki raised there. |
| 4 | [Ogres](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ogre-xmm.md) and [ettins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ettin-xmm.md) cowed by a [young red dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon-xmm.md) wander the foothills near the dragon's lair, helping to drive away intruders. |
| 5 | A colony of [mind flayers](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer-xmm.md) has captured and controlled a [young red dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon-xmm.md), which now guards the passages to the illithids' underground lair. |
| 6 | A parent of a [young red dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon-xmm.md) has become a dracolich, and the dragon wishes to see the Undead abomination destroyed. |
