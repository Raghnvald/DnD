|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A [young gold dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-gold-dragon-xmm.md) enjoys the company of [treants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant-xmm.md), who share the dragon's long view of history and methodical conversational style. |
| 2 | A [young gold dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-gold-dragon-xmm.md) lives in a cluster of stone spires and has secured the service of the [galeb duhr](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/galeb-duhr-xmm.md) who watch over the site. |
| 3 | An [arcanaloth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/arcanaloth-xmm.md) has secured a contract requiring a [young gold dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-gold-dragon-xmm.md) to serve the Fiend once every five years.
