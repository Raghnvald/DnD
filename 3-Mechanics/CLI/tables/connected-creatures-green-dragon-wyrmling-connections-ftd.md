| dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A [green dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/green-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) is the centerpiece of a traveling circus but might not be a prisoner after all. |
| 2 | A [green dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/green-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) was raised by a cluster of [pseudodragons](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon-xmm.md), whom the wyrmling now protects. |
| 3 | Hobgoblin raiders have captured several [green dragon wyrmlings](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/green-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md), hoping to use them as the vanguards of their war parties. |
| 4 | A [green dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/green-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) exacerbates the chaotic tendencies of a group of [satyrs](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/satyr-xmm.md), driving them to greater acts of mischief with the promise of rich rewards. |
| 5 | A [green dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/green-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) tricks a village of lizardfolk into believing the dragon is an incarnation of a lizardfolk god. |
| 6 | An ancient [couatl](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/couatl-xmm.md) attempts to shape the moral outlook of a [green dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/green-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md), so the dragon might inherit the duty of guarding the couatl's treasures. |
