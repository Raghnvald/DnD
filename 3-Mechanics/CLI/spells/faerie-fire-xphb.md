Objects in a 20-foot [Cube](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) within range are outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Each creature in the [Cube](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is also outlined if it fails a Dexterity saving throw.
