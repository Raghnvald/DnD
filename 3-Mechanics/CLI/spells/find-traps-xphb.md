# Find Traps
*2nd-level, Divination*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You sense any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes any object or mechanism that was created to cause damage or other danger. Thus, the spell would sense the [Alarm](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/alarm-xphb.md) or [Glyph of Warding](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/glyph-of-warding-xphb.md) spell or a mechanical pit trap, but it wouldn't reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This spell reveals that a trap is present but not its location. You do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.
