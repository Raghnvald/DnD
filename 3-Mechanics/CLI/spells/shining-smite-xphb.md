The target hit by the strike takes an extra `2d6` Radiant damage from the attack. Until the spell ends, the target sheds [Bright Light](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 5-foot radius, attack rolls against it have [Advantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md), and it can't benefit from the [Invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Invisible) condition.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [Artificer (Battle Smith)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-battle-smith-tce.md "subclass=TCE;class=TCE"); [Paladin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md); [Warlock (The Hexblade)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-the-hexblade-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB")
