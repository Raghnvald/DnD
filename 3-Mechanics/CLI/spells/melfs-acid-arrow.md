# Melf's Acid Arrow
*2nd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder's stomach)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `4d4` acid damage immediately and `2d4` acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by `1d4` for each slot level above 2nd.
