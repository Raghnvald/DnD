*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 253*  

In his youth, Darz was a member of the Xanathar Thieves' Guild in Waterdeep. After serving ten years in prison for his crimes, he cut all ties to the city and moved north to be a campground caretaker.

Ideal:"You can run from your past, but you can't hide from it."

Bond:"I've made a new life in Triboar. I'm not gonna run away this time."

Flaw:"I have no regrets. I do whatever it takes to survive."
