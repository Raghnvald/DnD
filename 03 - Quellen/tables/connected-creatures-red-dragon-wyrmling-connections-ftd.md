**Red Dragon Wyrmling Connections**

| dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A [fire giant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/fire-giant-xmm.md) lord has captured a [red dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/red-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) and is looking to train the willful creature as a pet. |
| 2 | A [red dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/red-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) adopted a nest of [fire snakes](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/salamander-fire-snake-xmm.md), which have now grown into [salamanders](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/salamander-xmm.md) who protect the wyrmling. |
| 3 | A band of [kobolds](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/kobold-warrior-xmm.md) was driven out of its warren by a [red dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/red-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md); they now raid to survive—and to gather offerings to propitiate "the winged god." |
| 4 | A tiefling child has secretly hidden and raised a [red dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/red-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) from an egg. The wyrmling is bonded to the child, but dangerous to anyone else. |
| 5 | A bound [fire elemental](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental-xmm.md) serves as the guardian of an orphaned [red dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/red-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md). |
| 6 | A band of [hobgoblins](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/hobgoblin-warrior-xmm.md) is thrown into chaos when a [red dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/red-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) supports a coup by an ambitious war leader, in exchange for tribute. |
