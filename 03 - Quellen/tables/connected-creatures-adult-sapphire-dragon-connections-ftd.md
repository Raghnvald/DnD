**Adult Sapphire Dragon Connections**

| dice: d8 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | An [adult sapphire dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-sapphire-dragon-ftd.md) lives adjacent to active [purple worm](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm-xmm.md) tunnels, hoping the threat of the worm will deter treasure hunters. |
| 2 | An [adult sapphire dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-sapphire-dragon-ftd.md) employs a [dao](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/dao-xmm.md) to help shape and defend the dragon's lair, and the dao maintains a portal to the Elemental Plane of Earth there. |
| 3 | An [adult sapphire dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-sapphire-dragon-ftd.md) regularly confers with a plane-hopping [archmage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/archmage-xmm.md) regarding the dragon's ongoing dreams of other worlds and other lives. |
| 4 | A [drow priestess of Lolth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/fiend-cultist-xmm.md) and several [yochlol](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/yochlol-xmm.md) demons have been ordered by their goddess to deal with the [adult sapphire dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-sapphire-dragon-ftd.md) who has been hunting her holy spiders. |
| 5 | A forgetful and nearsighted [adult sapphire dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-sapphire-dragon-ftd.md) believes a [blue dragon wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/blue-dragon-wyrmling-xmm.md) is actually the [sapphire wyrmling](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/sapphire-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) who left home months before. |
| 6 | An [adult sapphire dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-sapphire-dragon-ftd.md) and a squadron of githyanki have joined forces to locate and destroy a [mind flayer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer-xmm.md) colony. |
| 7 | A group of [stone giants](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant-xmm.md) believes a [young sapphire dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-sapphire-dragon-ftd.md) to be an emissary of their god, Skoraeus Stonebones. The dragon considers the notion ridiculous but loves having an audience who will listen to lectures on military history without complaint. |
| 8 | An [adult sapphire dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/adult-sapphire-dragon-ftd.md) and an [aboleth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/aboleth-xmm.md) psychically face off for control of an area of the Underdark. The constant bombardment of psychic forces has begun to affect the local fauna in strange ways. |
