**Young Green Dragon Connections**

| dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A [young green dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-green-dragon-xmm.md) and a [treant](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant-xmm.md) vie for influence over a woodland region. |
| 2 | A [young green dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-green-dragon-xmm.md) forces a group of [dryads](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/dryad-xmm.md) to collect treasures for the dragon's hoard, threatening to destroy their trees if they refuse. |
| 3 | An infestation of [twig blights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/twig-blight-xmm.md) has taken over the lair of a [young green dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-green-dragon-xmm.md), and the dragon will do anything to reclaim it. |
| 4 | [Green hags](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/green-hag-xmm.md) compete to gain an alliance with a [young green dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-green-dragon-xmm.md), turning a village into a staging ground for their games of deceit. |
| 5 | A [young green dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-green-dragon-xmm.md) directs a conclave of yuan-ti under the command of a [yuan-ti abomination](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/yuan-ti-abomination-xmm.md), ordering the serpentfolk to search the forgotten tunnels of a city for the ancient treasures buried there. |
| 6 | An [oni](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/oni-xmm.md) and a [young green dragon](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/young-green-dragon-xmm.md) work together to terrorize a village, taking a victim every night and leaving the rest too frightened to flee. |
