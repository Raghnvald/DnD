Sasha Ivliskova 
Roleplaying Information
Resonance. Sasha should make the players feel sympathetic toward her clear discomfort as one of Strahd's brides, endeared to her for her efforts to maintain her dignity in the face of dismissal and cruelty from Strahd's other brides, and mildly put off by her standoffish reluctance to allow others to get close to her.

Emotions. Sasha most often feels melancholy, anxious, despondent, uncomfortable, anguished, reluctant, or fearful. If treated with kindness, she might feel grateful or hopeful.

Motivations. Sasha is motivated by her desire to avoid Strahd's wrath, protect other vulnerable Barovians from falling under Strahd's thrall, and free herself from the vampiric curse of undeath.

Inspirations. When roleplaying Sasha, channel Sansa Stark (Game of Thrones)), Katniss Everdeen (The Hunger Games), and Elsa (Frozen).

Character Information
Persona. To the world, Sasha is a quiet, brooding vampire with little interest in others. To those she trusts, Sasha is a sorrowful, guilt-ridden soul desperate to escape her monstrous existence.

Morale. In a fight, Sasha would seek to flee or entreat her adversary, fighting only if cornered by an evil or malevolent opponent.

Relationships. Sasha is Strahd's first bride and a secret friend to Gertruda, Doru's betrothed and Strahd's prisoner.
