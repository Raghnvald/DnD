Milivoj (N male human commoner) is rarely seen without a shovel, which he wields like a club. Modify his statistics as follows:

-His Strength is 15 (+2).
His melee weapon attack bonus is +4, and he deals 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage when he hits with the blunt head of his shovel.
Milivoj rejects the burgomaster’s proclamation that “All will be well!” and is frustrated that he can’t protect his younger siblings. He wants to be free of Barovia’s curse but sees no hope of escape.
