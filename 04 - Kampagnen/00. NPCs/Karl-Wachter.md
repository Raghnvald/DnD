Nikolai and Karl Wachter (N male human [nobles](ddb://monsters/16966)) are brothers of noble birth. They are brash drunkards always looking for trouble, though they are smart enough not to pick fights with well-armed strangers. Their mother, Fiona Wachter (see [area N4](ddb://compendium/cos/the-town-of-vallaki#AreasofVallaki#N4Wachterhaus "area N4")), is an influential figure in town, but her sons never talk about her. They’d rather listen to tales of the characters’ harrowing adventures or hear about how the characters plan to free Vallaki from the burgomaster’s madness.
