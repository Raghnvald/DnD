# Haste
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a shaving of licorice root
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the [Attack](rules/actions.md#Attack) (one weapon attack only), [Dash](rules/actions.md#Dash), [Disengage](rules/actions.md#Disengage), [Hide](rules/actions.md#Hide), or [Use an Object](rules/actions.md#Use%20an%20Object) action.

When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

**Classes**: [Sorcerer](../Charakteroptionen/Klassen/Zauberer.md), [Wizard](../Charakteroptionen/Klassen/Magier.md)
