# Spike Growth
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes `2d4` piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom ([Perception](/3-Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Perception)) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.

**Classes**: [Bard (Magical Secrets)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric (Nature Domain)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-nature-domain.md); [Druid (Circle of the Land, Arctic)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-land.md); [Druid](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md)
