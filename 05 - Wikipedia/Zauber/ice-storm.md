# Ice Storm
*4th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `2d8` bludgeoning damage and `4d6` cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn the storm's area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 4th.
