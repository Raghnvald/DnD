# Blade Barrier
*6th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of whirling blades made of magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides Three-Quarters [Cover](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md), and its space is [Difficult Terrain](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md).

Any creature in the wall's space makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `6d10` Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes that save if it enters the wall's space or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.

**Classes**: [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul, Good)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB")
