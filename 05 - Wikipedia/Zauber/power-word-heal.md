# Power Word Heal
*9th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed), [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened), [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Paralyzed), or [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Stunned), the condition ends. If the creature is [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone), it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

**Classes**: [Bard (Magical Secrets)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
