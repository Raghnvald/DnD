# Phantasmal Killer
*4th-level, Illusion*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened) for the duration. At the end of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `4d10` psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 4th.

**Classes**: [Bard (Magical Secrets)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster.md); [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
