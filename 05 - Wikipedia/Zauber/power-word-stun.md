# Power Word Stun
*8th-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Stunned). Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The [stunned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Stunned) target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.

**Classes**: [Bard (Magical Secrets)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Sorcerer](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Warlock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
