# Sending
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Unlimited
- **Components:** V, S, a short piece of fine copper wire
- **Duration:** 1 round

You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5% chance chance that the message doesn't arrive.
