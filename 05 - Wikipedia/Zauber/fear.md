# Fear
*3rd-level, Illusion*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Cone)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a white feather or the heart of a hen)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened) for the duration.

While [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened) by this spell, a creature must take the [Dash](/3-Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Dash) action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
