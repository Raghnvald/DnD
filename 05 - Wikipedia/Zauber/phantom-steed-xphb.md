# Phantom Steed
*3rd-level, Illusion (ritual)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/phantom-steed.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

A Large, quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, and it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The steed uses the [Riding Horse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/riding-horse-xmm.md) stat block, except it has a [Speed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) of 100 feet and can travel 13 miles in an hour. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends early if the steed takes any damage.
