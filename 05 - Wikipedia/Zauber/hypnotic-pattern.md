# Hypnotic Pattern
*3rd-level, Illusion*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a glowing stick of incense or a crystal vial filled with phosphorescent material)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) for the duration. While [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) by this spell, the creature is [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated) and has a speed of 0.

The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
