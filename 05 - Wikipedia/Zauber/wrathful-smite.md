The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your attack deals an extra `1d6` psychic damage. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened) of you until the spell ends. As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.

**Classes**: [Bard (Magical Secrets)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Paladin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md)
