# Silence
*2nd-level, Illusion (ritual)*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) has [Immunity](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to Thunder damage, and creatures have the [Deafened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Deafened) condition while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a Verbal component is impossible there.

**Classes**: [Bard (College of Lore)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Ranger](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul, Good)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Warlock (The Fathomless)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-the-fathomless-tce.md "subclass=TCE;class=XPHB")
