# Protection from Evil and Good
*1st-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed), [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened), or possessed by them. If the target is already [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed), [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened), or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

**Classes**: [Bard (Magical Secrets)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight.md); [Paladin (Oath of Devotion)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-devotion.md); [Paladin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster.md); [Warlock](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Wizard](/3-Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
