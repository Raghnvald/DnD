A storm of fire appears within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot Cubes, which you arrange as you like. Each [Cube](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) must be contiguous with at least one other [Cube](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md). Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `7d10` Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried start [burning](/3-Mechanics/CLI/traps-hazards/burning-xphb.md).
