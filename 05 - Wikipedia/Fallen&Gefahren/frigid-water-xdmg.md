# Frigid Water
*Environmental Hazard*  

A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [Exhaustion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Exhaustion) level. Creatures with [Resistance](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) or [Immunity](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water.
