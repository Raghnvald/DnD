# Desecrated Ground
*Wilderness Hazard*  

Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the unseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated ground can be any size, and a [detect evil and good](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good-xphb.md) spell cast within range reveals its presence.

Undead standing on desecrated ground have advantage on all saving throws.

A vial of [holy water](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/holy-water-xphb.md) purifies a 10-foot-square area of desecrated ground when sprinkled on it, and a [hallow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hallow-xphb.md) spell purifies desecrated ground within its area.
