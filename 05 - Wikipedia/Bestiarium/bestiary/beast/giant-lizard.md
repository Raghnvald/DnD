# [Giant Lizard](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\beast/giant-lizard.md)
*Source: Monster Manual p. 326. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span> and the Basic Rules (2014)*  

A giant lizard can be ridden or used as a draft animal. Lizardfolk also keep them as pets, and subterranean giant lizards are used as mounts and pack animals by drow, duergar, and other Underdark dwellers.
