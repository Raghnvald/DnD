Warlords are legendary battlefield commanders, whose names are spoken with awe. After a string of decisive victories, a warlord could easily take on the role of monarch or general and attract followers willing to die for the warlord's banner.

Warlords urge their troops into the fray with shouted exhortations. You can roll on the Warlord Battle Cries table to select one, or choose a battle cry that fits with your campaign.

**Warlord Battle Cries**

| dice: d8 | Battle Cry |
|----------|------------|
| 1 | "Remember why we fight!" |
| 2 | "Victory awaits!" |
| 3 | "For the crown!" |
| 4 | "Be monstrous to the enemy!" |
| 5 | "Fight so they fear us!" |
| 6 | "Weapons drawn! Spells at the ready!" |
| 7 | "To the Abyss with them!" |
| 8 | "You know what to do!" |
