The Azorius Senate has spellcasters who are trained to capture lawbreakers and bring them to justice. A lawmage's magic is focused on restraining criminals and on protecting bystanders from becoming casualties when arresters are pursuing malefactors. A significant proportion of the guild's vedalken are lawmages.
