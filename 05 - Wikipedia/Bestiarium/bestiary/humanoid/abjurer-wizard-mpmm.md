Abjurers specialize in creating protective magical wards. Monarchs, nobles, and other wealthy individuals commonly hire abjurers to provide protection.

## Wizards

Wizards pursue magical power through the study of arcane texts. Some travel the world searching for esoteric tomes while others train lesser wizards or collaborate with colleagues to create new spells.
