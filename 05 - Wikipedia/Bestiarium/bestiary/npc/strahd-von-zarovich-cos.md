# [Strahd von Zarovich](3-Mechanics\CLI\bestiary\npc/strahd-von-zarovich-cos.md)
*Source: Curse of Strahd p. 240*  

With his mind sharp and his heart dark, Strahd von Zarovich is a formidable foe. Courage and lives beyond measure have been lost to him. Reread chapter 1, "Into the Mists," to understand his personality and goals.

Although Strahd can be encountered almost anywhere in his domain, the vampire is always encountered in the place indicated by the card reading in chapter 1, unless he has been forced into his tomb in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft.

## Strahd's Tactics

Because the entire adventure revolves around Strahd, you must play him intelligently and do everything you can to make him a terrifying and cunning adversary for the player characters.

When you run an encounter with Strahd, keep the following facts in mind:

- Strahd attacks at the most advantageous moment and from the most advantageous position.  
- Strahd knows when he's in over his head. If he begins taking more damage than he can regenerate, he moves beyond the reach of melee combatants and spellcasters, or he flies away (using summoned wolves or swarms of bats or rats to guard his retreat).  
- Strahd observes the characters to see who among them are most easily swayed, then tries to charm characters who have low Wisdom scores and use them as thralls. At the very least, he can order a [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) character to guard him against other members of the adventuring party.  

## The Vampire's Minions

Whenever Strahd appears in a location other than his tomb or the place indicated by the card reading, roll a `d20` and consult the Strahd's Minions table to determine what creatures he brings with him, if any.

## Strahd's Minions

| dice: d20 | Creatures |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1–3 | `1d4 + 2` [dire wolves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/dire-wolf-xmm.md) |
| 4–6 | `1d6 + 3` [ghouls](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghoul-xmm.md) |
| 7–9 | `1d4 + 2` [Strahd zombies](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/strahd-zombie-cos.md) (in this appendix) |
| 10–12 | `2d4` [swarms of bats](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-bats-xmm.md) |
| 13–15 | `1d4 + 1` [vampire spawn](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/vampire-spawn-xmm.md) |
| 16–18 | `3d6` [wolves](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/wolf-xmm.md) |
| 19–20 | None |
^creatures

If the characters are in a residence, Strahd's creatures break through doors and windows to reach them, or crawl up through the earth, or swoop down the chimney. The vampire spawn (all that's left of a party of adventurers that Strahd defeated long ago) can't enter the characters' location unless invited.

## Heart of Sorrow

Strahd can afford to be bold in his tactics, for he has additional protection in the form of a giant crystal heart hidden inside Castle Ravenloft.

Any damage that Strahd takes is transferred to the Heart of Sorrow (see chapter 4, area K20). If the heart absorbs damage that reduces it to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and Strahd takes any leftover damage. The Heart of Sorrow has 50 hit points and is restored to that number of hit points each dawn, provided it has at least 1 hit point remaining. Strahd can, as a bonus action on his turn, break his link to the Heart of Sorrow so that it no longer absorbs damage dealt to him. Strahd can reestablish his link to the Heart of Sorrow as a bonus action on his turn, but only while in Castle Ravenloft.

The effect of the protection afforded by the Heart of Sorrow can be chilling to behold, as damage to Strahd is quickly undone. For example, a critical hit might dislocate Strahd's jaw, but only for a moment; then the vampire's jaw quickly resets itself.

The ability of the Heart of Sorrow to absorb damage is suppressed if it or Strahd is fully within an [antimagic field](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/antimagic-field-xphb.md).
