      \ Vistana takes 1d6 psychic damage.  \n- The target's appearance changes in\
      \ a sinister yet purely cosmetic way. For example, the curse can place a scar\
      \ on the target's face, turn the target's teeth into yellow fangs, or give the\
      \ target bad breath. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 1d6 psychic damage.\

      \ and can't be found until the curse ends. The lost item can weigh no more than\
      \ 1 pound. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 1d6 psychic damage.  \n-\

      \ disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws tied to one ability score\
      \ of the Vistana's choice. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 3d6 psychic\
      \ damage.  \n- The target's attunement to one magic item (chosen by the DM)\

      \ or both. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 5d6 psychic damage.  \n\n\

      \ spell, a [remove curse](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse-xphb.md) spell,\
