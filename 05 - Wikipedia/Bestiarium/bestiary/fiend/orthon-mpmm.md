*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 205*  

When an archduke of the Nine Hells needs a creature tracked, found, and either done away with or captured, the task usually falls to an orthon. These devils are infernal bounty hunters, tireless in their pursuit of their quarry across the multiverse.

Orthons are infamous for their sharp senses. Because an orthon can become invisible at will, its quarry is often unaware of being hunted until the orthon strikes. This invisibility can be disrupted when the devil is attacked, however, so a strong counterattack is often the best defense against it.

Orthons value the challenge of the chase and the thrill of one-on-one combat above all else. An orthon's first loyalty is to its archduke, but one with no immediate assignment might work for anyone who promises it a worthy struggle against a lethal foe. Because they travel widely, orthons are unequaled as guides through the layers of the Nine Hells.

      \ taking an additional 17 (5d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much\
      \ damage on a successful one.  \n- **Blindness.** The target takes 5 (1d10)\
      \ radiant damage. In addition, the target and all other creatures within 20\
      \ feet of it must each make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be\
      \ [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Blinded) until the end of the orthon's\
      \ next turn.  \n- **Concussion.** The target and each creature within 20 feet\
      \ of it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 13 (2d12) thunder\
      \ damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n-\
      \ **Entanglement.** The target must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving\
      \ throw or be [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) for 1\
      \ hour by strands of sticky webbing. The target can escape by taking an action\
      \ to make a DC 17 Strength or Dexterity check and succeeding.  \n- **Paralysis.**\
      \ The target takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage and must make a successful DC\
      \ 17 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Paralyzed)\

      \ plane of existence. If the target is on a different plane, the orthon knows\
