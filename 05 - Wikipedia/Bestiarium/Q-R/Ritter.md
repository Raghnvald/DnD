> ## Actions

> ***Multiattack.*** The knight makes two melee attacks.
> 
> ***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`2W6 + 3`) slashing damage.
> 
> ***Heavy Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1W10`) piercing damage.
> 
> ***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the knight can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a `W4` to its roll provided it can hear and understand the knight. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the knight is [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

> ## Reactions

> ***Parry.*** The knight adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
