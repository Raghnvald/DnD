*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 201*  

You gain the following benefits.

**Instrument Training.** You gain proficiency with three Musical Instruments of your choice.

**Encouraging Song.** As you finish a Short or Long Rest, you can play a song on a Musical Instrument with which you have proficiency and give [Heroic Inspiration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/heroic-inspiration-xphb.md) to allies who hear the song. The number of allies you can affect in this way equals your Proficiency Bonus.
