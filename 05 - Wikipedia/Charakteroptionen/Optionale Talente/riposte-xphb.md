# Riposte
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 95*  

When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can take a [Reaction](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) and expend one Superiority Die to make a melee attack roll with a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/unarmed-strike-xphb.md) against the creature. If you hit, add the Superiority Die to the attack's damage.
