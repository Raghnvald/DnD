# Heightened Spell
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 142. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span>*  

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to give one target of the spell [Disadvantage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on saves against the spell.
