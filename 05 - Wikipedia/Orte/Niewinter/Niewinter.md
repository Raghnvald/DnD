# Layout

After the Mount Hotenow eruption in 1451 DR, the city was almost destroyed. After the rebuilding project, the layout was drastically changed:

The Protector's Enclave, located where the City Core, the Peninsula District, and the Merchant Quarter once stood.[54][33]

The Blacklake District was now the northwestern section of the city.[54][33]

The Docks District became part of the Protector's Enclave to the south, and the Blacklake District to the north.[54][33]

The Neverdeath Graveyard was built as the main graveyard of the city.[54]

The Arcanist Quarter and the Beggar's Nest were completely destroyed, being replaced by the Chasm.[54][note 2] The Chasm was sealed around 1485 DR.[33][36]

The River District, also known as the Towers District, located at the northeastern portion of the city.[54][16]

## Protectors Enclave

The Protector's Enclave was one of the districts of Neverwinter, named after Dagult Neverember, the Lord Protector of the city.[1]


### Geography
Most of the original buildings of this district were left unscathed after the destruction of the city. As such, the Protector's Enclave was the only part of Neverwinter that looked like it did in its old days.[1]

### Economy
The city's market, where all commerce in Neverwinter took place, was located in the Protector's Enclave. Merchants from Waterdeep and other cities of the Sword Coast had to pay high taxes to sell their wares here.[1]

### Inhabitants
Besides Lord Neverember and his underlings, the Protector's Enclave was inhabited by survivors of the cataclysm as well as immigrants who took up residence in the city after its recovery.[1] Most of the inhabitants of the Protector's Enclave were staunch supporters of Neverember's rule.[4]

### History
The Protector's Enclave was originally known as the Merchant Quarter of Neverwinter.[5][note 1] This district in turn was part of other two different districts: the City Core and the Peninsula District. Both were heavily damaged during the war against Luskan. The damaged parts were rebuilt as a different district.[2]

When the Spellplague of 1385 DR struck Neverwinter, the lands surrounding the Moonstone Mask became an earthmote.[6]

When Mount Hotenow erupted in 1451 DR, bringing about the destruction of most of Neverwinter, the southwestern part of the city was left mostly untouched by the pyroclastic flow. This made this quadrant a primary target for Lord Neverember when he began his efforts to rebuild Neverwinter. He later fused the City Core, the Peninsula District and the Merchant Quarter into only one area. Soon after, survivors of the cataclysm, as well as new immigrants began to quickly repopulate the district.[1]

As the seat of power of Neverember, the district was soon renamed the "Protector's Enclave" by the people.[1]

## Blacklake District

The Blacklake District was one of the districts of Neverwinter. It was named after the eponymous Blacklake at its heart.[1]

### History
#### 14th century
In the mid-to-late 14th century DR, the Blacklake District was the northern district of Neverwinter.[4][5]

During the city's struggle with the Wailing Death in the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, the Blacklake District was barred to the public to stop the plague from entering. The few who were allowed access found the District's population in turmoil from food scarcity. Much of the conflict centered on the wizard Meldanen, who had hoarded great amounts of food in his warehouse, and was known for his cruel magical experiments. The noble Formosa Laitannen loudly opposed Meldanen and his acts, and actively tried to hire someone to kill the mage.[5]

With the murders caused by the warlock Ammon Jerro in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, the district was cut off once more pending investigation. After entering the district, the Kalach-Cha managed to find the wizard Aldanon, who would later prove invaluable to the quest for the Silver Sword of Gith.[6]

#### 15th century
When Mount Hotenow erupted in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR, bringing about the destruction of most of Neverwinter, the northwestern district was left mostly untouched by the pyroclastic flow, although the Blacklake became a pit of debris, garbage, and ash from the eruption.[1] In the rebuilt city, the Blacklake District lay in the northwestern part of Neverwinter, while the northeastern became the River District.[4]

By 1479 DR, Dagult Neverember's efforts to rebuild the Blacklake District had been fruitless because of obstruction by the Sons of Alagondar and their allies.[1]

The Nashers moved in to take over the district and use it as their base of operations. The Nashers stole from the poor to finance their rebellion against Neverember, leading poor citizens to hire adventurers to deal with them for the sake of stability. They openly defied Lord Neverember's dictates and attacked those who did not swear loyalty, driving off the rest. For those who refused to leave, they burned down their houses or else barricaded them inside. The Ashmadai were trying to infiltrate the gang. Meanwhile, the Neverwinter Guard made a ramshackle defense of certain areas and gates out. An undercover Harper spy operated amongst the Blacklake gangs, communicating via coded messages stashed in secret places with handlers like Elminster and they sought to capture coded messages from the Dead Rats to decrypt.[3]

Later that year, to celebrate Neverwinter's successes, Lord Neverember declared the Protector's Jubilee. The event drew merchants from up and down the Sword Coast but some came through Blacklake District and needed escorting by adventurers.[3]

### Description
The buildings remained largely intact in the wake of the various disasters that laid the city low. This was thanks to the nobles who'd previously inhabited the District, as they had built buildings and other structures using quality materials and sound architectural techniques, and protected them with magic.[1]

However, most buildings were later repurposed into makeshift barracks to defend Neverwintan survivors against the dangers that plagued the city after its destruction, while others just fell into disrepair over time, or were vandalized by vagrants, making the district look significantly different from what it used to.[1]

On the southeast shore of Blacklake lay two particularly troubled areas, the Tatters and Riverside, which were linked by a short bridge. Both largely lay in ruins. Some "notable" locations in the Tatters were, or had been, Brimbleton Place, Chadwick Stoop, and Thatcher Road, but in ruins these were little different from anywhere else.[3]

The Blacklake at the center was filled with ash and volcanic debris, filth, and trash dumped by the locals, as well as several destroyed ships. It came to resemble a vast midden more than a lake, overflowing with a dense black sludge. It even developed magical properties and gave rise to sludge-covered zombies in the streets, suggesting it was more than mere pollution, and alchemists like Hazel studied the phenomenon. A drow self-proclaimed Chosen of Ghaunadaur later led an attack of sludge zombies on Blacklake District in 1479 DR, suggesting that he or his god had transformed the sludge.[3]

Even though several well-detailed and annotated maps of the Blacklake District existed, their mass production was banned by Lord Nasher to protect the district and the city from any illicit and spy activity. Very few maps were in existence, with one of them found in Gillian's Hill's curio store - Torleth's Treasures in 1372 DR.[7]

### Inhabitants
In the mid-to-late 14th century DR, the Blacklake District was inhabited by Neverwinter's nobles, before the destruction of the city in the Mount Hotenow in 1451 DR. Afterward, a few survivors and refugees that decided to remain in the city relocated themselves to the District.[1]

These survivors were generally highly nationalist and proud of the Alagondar lineage, and violently resisted Dagult Neverember's rule. The Nashers claimed the area for themselves, daring Neverember's soldiers and mercenaries to try to take it from them by force.[8][3] The Nashers and Dead Rats gang largely prowled the Tatters, with the Dead Rats based in the sewers of Blacklake District.[3]

Likewise, the Ashmadai under Mordai Vell had gained a foothold in the Blacklake District, even infiltrating the ranks of both the nationalist refugees and Neverember's troops stationed in the district.[8][3]

In addition, circa 1479 DR, someone regularly graffitied a wall of a dilapidated building in the south with Iokharic writing (the language unrecognized) and a symbol. Locals believed the images were evil and worried of a devil-worshiping cult in the area. They were mistaken—it was a dragon-worshiping cult.[3]

## Neverdeath Graveyard

Neverdeath, also called the Neverdeath Graveyard, was the burial ground and cemetery of Neverwinter. It was named for a common blessing given over the dead: as long as the city remained in summer, it was believed that the dead would not turn into undead.[1]


### Description
Neverdeath consisted of two wide, roughly square areas of the city surrounded by a thick and looming black wall of stone and wood pierced by stark black gates.[1][2] Each of these was a sprawling cemetery: the so-called Main Graveyard was located in the northeastern of the two sections, while the southwestern section was known as the Pauper's Section.[3][4] The graveyards included sprawling rows of tombstones interspersed with old trees, crumbling statues, and mausoleums.[1][2] These mausoleums were interconnected via underground catacombs that extended under both cemeteries.[1][5][6]

The graveyard was considered sacred to Kelemvor, and doomguides from the Eternal Order of Kelemvor were responsible for protection of the area.[7]

### Geography
It was located within the Neverwinter city walls, and lay on the southern edge of town near the Protector's Enclave.[3][4] A cobblestone street surrounded the graveyard, and no buildings were built within 50 paces its outer walls.[2]

In Neverdeath's same location on the Shadowfell were Evernight's Graveyard (coinciding with the Pauper's Section) and the Corpse Market (coinciding with the Main Graveyard).[8]

### History
Neverdeath was a centuries-old burial ground for the people of Neverwinter.[7] It was struck hard by the Spellplague of 1385 DR as well as by the Ruining of 1451 DR, which collapsed buildings, exposed graves, and changed the elevation of some sections to create small, jutting cliffs scattered with bones and coffins. It was left to fall into disrepair, becoming overgrown with withered grasses and clogged with rubble and overgrown brush.[1][2] Although its walls had become cracked, they were patched[1] and the eastern edge of the graveyard became the southern anchor of The Wall that fortified Neverwinter against the horrors of the Chasm.[9]

The graveyard was still used to bury the dead—albeit with much simpler markers and haphazard graves than before the disasters[7]—until Thayan forces under Valindra Shadowmantle seized the graveyard in the mid-to-late 15th century DR, despite the best efforts of the doomguides. The Thayans began to use their necromancy spells to raise the corpses buried in Neverdeath as undead minions, and used the mausoleums as a base.[1][7] The place became so haunted that even daylight appeared murky within the graveyard's walls.[2] By 1479 DR, the number of undead was growing at an alarming rate[7] and unattended corpses might spontaneously rise from the dead, leading people to become fearful of the graveyard and preferring to cremate their dead instead of burying them in Neverdeath.[1] The gates were always kept closed, and if ever they opened, it would draw the attention of concerned onlookers.[2]

Also in 1479 DR, the Red Wizard Tolivast hid in Neverdeath while cursing the Crown of Neverwinter.[10] While Tolivast had control over a small army of undead, he was chased down by a group of adventurers that killed him, retrieved the Crown, and destroyed most of his undead minions.[2][11] Around the same time, yet another Red Wizard necromancer named Jack began raising undead in the cemetery.[12]

Finally, following the events of the Siege of Neverwinter, the Neverwinter Guard turned its attention to Valindra's activities in Neverdeath, and sent the Heroes of the Sleeping Dragon Bridge to assist the Kelemvorites—led by Doomguide Volahk—in ending her plots. From the Kelemvorites' last foothold of Doomguide's Watch, the adventurers started by culling the undead, rescuing Doomguides throughout Pauper's Field, and reconsecrating the area. The adventurers also delivered the phylactery of the lich Zarifrax to Volahk, ended a Thayan effort to revive a dangerous ogre named Arleon the Unforgiven, helped the Harper agent Windle to thwart a plot by the Cult of the Dragon, and clashed with Valindra's forces at the Clockwork Tomb. Ultimately, they succeeded in driving out the Thayans from the graveyard, and were able to report evidence of her future plans to Neverwinter's Sergeant Knox.[7]

Sometime in the 1480s DR,[note 1] Neverdeath became the site of infighting by members of the Cult of the Dragon between traditionalists and the followers of Severin Silrajin, who were seeking the remains of Cruven Gantara with the aid of the green dragon Charthraxis. The Harpers coordinated efforts to thwart both factions, led by an agent named Boward.[13]

The graveyard continued to be infested with undead as of at least 1491 DR.[14]

### Notable Locations
#### Main Graveyard
The Main Graveyard was the northeastern walled-in half of the graveyard.[3][4] The thick western wall separating it from the Pauper's Section was the site of numerous towering mausoleums with interconnected catacombs.[14] Notable locations in the Main Graveyard included:

- Craftsman's Rest, an old section of the cemetery containing ornamental tombs and graves.[7] Craftsman's Rest in turn contained:
	- A shadow crossing to Evernight located in the center.[1][7]
	- The Artisan's Tomb.[7]
	- The Waterclock Guild's Crypts, a massive complex beneath an unassuming mausoleum dedicated the city's Waterclock Guild.[5][7]

- Hallix Mausoleum, the humble family tomb of the Neverwinter Hallix family.[14]
- Merchant's Landing, a section where many of the most prominent merchants of Neverwinter were interred.[13]
- The Monini Crypts, the family tombs of the Neverwinter Monini family.[7]

#### Pauper's Section

The Pauper's Section, also known as Pauper's Field[7] or the Pauper's Graveyard,[6] was the southwestern walled-in half of the graveyard.[3][4] It was a hilly area that traditionally served as the place where Neverwinter's poorest were buried, and which became a site of mass graves following the Ruining.[7] It contained more simple headstones and tombs than the Main Graveyard. It's communal catacombs dated back to the establishment of Neverdeath, and had been built by a handful of civic-minded citizens.[6] Notable locations in the Pauper's Section included:

Crypt of Vers Never, a presumably empty tomb that was once intended for Vers Never.[7]
Graves of the Lucanis family.[7]
The Lynching Tree, a site where accused criminals were buried.[7]
A nondescript tomb recognizable only by an inscription above the doorway reading "Home Again, To Rest Forever". This tomb was connected to the Dolindar Tomb in Evernight via a Crevice of Dusk.[15]
The Rift, a ravine formed during past disasters.[7]
Soldier's Memorial, a burial section for military veterans.[7][13] Soldier's Memorial in turn contained:
The Soldier's Monument.[7]
The Wizard's Tomb.[7]

#### Inhabitants
As of 1479 DR, corpses were said to shamble about the graveyard at all hours.[16] This included skeletons, wights, and zombies (including zombie hulks).[7]

Any visitors to Neverdeath found themselves assailed by lesser undead creatures that burst from the ground. Many of these were servants of the Thayans, and were meant not only to deter intruders but to provide advance warning of any threats to their operations.[1] At this time, living cultists and gnolls allied with the Thayans also became active in the area. Despite these dangers, unscrupulous individuals were known to hunt for treasures in the graves.[7]

## River District

The River District was one of the districts of Neverwinter in the late 15th century DR.[1] Its eastern end was also known as the Tower District, after its three notable landmarks: the Cloak Tower, the Fallen Tower that had once stood there, and the hovering Shard of Night.[1][3]

### Geography
The River District was the northeastern district of Neverwinter, and was named after the Neverwinter River, which marked its southern edge. To the west was the Blacklake District.[1][4]

### History

The eruption of Mount Hotenow in the Year of Knowledge Unearthed, 1451 DR destroyed most of the River District.[3]

Fortunately, the Neverwinter River formed a natural barrier that protected the River District from being overrun by the plaguechanged creatures that appeared from the Chasm in the city's south.[1]

In the late 1470s DR, a vanguard force of orcs from the Many-Arrows kingdom under commander Vansi arrived at Neverwinter. They penetrated the city walls and established a base camp in the shadow of the abandoned Cloak Tower. Then they occupied the tower itself, making it their headquarters. From there, they claimed territory in the Tower District, where the city was still ruined.[1][5] They even reopened the old Fallen Tower tavern. Enjoying the most well-defended stronghold in the district, the orcs could not be defeated or evicted and their presence prevented New Neverwinter's Mintarn mercenaries from pacifying the district. For a time in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR, Vansi and Lord Dagult Neverember held negotiations in the neutral ground of the Fallen Tower tavern and established a truce, until Neverember could work out how to evict them. The Fallen Tower marked the limit of New Neverwinter's reach into the River District on the occasion they made a patrol.[1]

Later that year, Vansi's orcs were finally in open war with Neverwinter across their part of the River District. They heavily fortified the area around the Cloak Tower, expanded their camp, took over an old private guard barracks, and turned the old Merchant Guild Hall into a fort. They attacked and killed all who trespassed upon their territory and looted whatever wealth they could find within and destroyed artworks and Neverwintan banners. The Neverwinter Guard fought to keep them contained with their own barricades, and supplemented their dwindling ranks with many adventurers. Captain Janros, Sergeant Creed, Scout Gaelen, and their adventurers waged a war to weaken and defeat Vansi's orc army. Finally, a party of adventurers infiltrated the Cloak Tower itself, relentlessly fought their way through the orc army and the tower, and slew Vansi Bloodscar herself.[3]

Around that time, Kynorath Greybeard led treasure hunts to recover lost Waukeenar relics from the ruins of the orc-occupied Tower District.[3]

Afterward, the River District was liberated and finally under Neverwintan control. The survivors of the orcish force departed, heading east to rejoin Many-Arrows. By 1489 DR, new citizens and old were reclaiming and restoring the old merchant villas along the river.[6]

### Inhabitants
Before the devastation of the city in the mid–15th century DR, the River District was inhabited by much of the merchant class of Neverwinter, together with their families and servants.[1] It was also home to a few nobles, merchants' guilds, and wizards.[3]

Afterward, the district was left largely abandoned, though some folk sneaked in for dares, adventures, or secret meetings, to take advantage of the privacy.[1] Many members of the Sons of Alagondar hailed from the old River District, so they knew the area much better than New Neverwinter's Mintarn mercenaries. They also returned to establish hideouts and safehouses.[7] Other River District refugees, meanwhile, had resettled in the House of Knowledge.[8]

Circa 1479 DR, an army of orcs and ogres from Many-Arrows seized the easternmost area known as the Tower District. They killed anyone who trespassed on their territory or interfered with their activities.[1][3]

Sometimes, beasts from the wilds got into the River District and hunted on its streets. They made it hazardous for refugees to return.[1] People also sighted plaguechanged monsters in the River District's north around 1479 DR.[9] In fact, the orcs kept a lid on the number of monsters in the district, including the plaguechanged, which were emerging from the sewers.[1]

### Description

Originally occupied by the merchant class, many of the houses built in this district were large and sturdy, but not especially ostentatious compared with those in the Blacklake District. Such houses could fit a family of up to eight people, together with their servants.[1]

There were also many guardhouses and security walls, though in the urban conflicts of 1479 DR, these provided cover for skirmishers and ambushers. At that time, a hastily built barricade was put up to separate much of the River and Blacklake Districts; however, the Mintarn mercenaries left it largely unguarded, instead just posting warning notices.[1]

Once, long flower gardens ran down the middle of every street, but by the late 1400s these had died off or been taken over by weeds.[1]

#### Tower Distrct
One notable area was Merchant Square, once a marketplace that received traders from up and down the Sword Coast, whether to buy, sell, or barter. It was the financial hub of Neverwinter, and was close to rivaling Waterdeep in terms of money exchanged each day. It lay near the Merchant Guild Hall. However, it was destroyed in the eruption and anything remaining of value pillaged by thieves, bandits, or orcs. Little more than a grassed-over battlefield remained in 1479 DR.[3]

On the other side of the Merchant Guild Hall was the neighborhood of Pedlars Path. Cobblers, tinkers, and other low-end merchants and craftsman lived, worked, and sold their wares around its narrow streets. The orcs later rebuilt these small houses into defensive structures.[3]

In contrast, Waukeen Way was where prosperous merchants built their stately manors and fine gardens. Most of these were destroyed in the eruption. Despite this, a single shrine to the Merchant's Friend remained standing within the ruins. As the name suggested, many of the merchants were worshipers of Waukeen and they kept private shrines boasting golden cornucopias believed to bless them with wealth; most of these cornucopias were lost in the destruction and occupation, but were recovered by Kynorath Greybeard.[3]

The Cloak Tower stood near where the Neverwinter River entered the city,[10][11] on its easternmost side, close to the city wall. In the 1400s DR, it was contained within a trapezoidal area filled with open parkland and trees and ringed by a fortified wall.[4] The Many-Arrows occupation of the area saw this space filled with orc camps and barracks, as well as barricades and watchtowers.[3]

# Organisations

Many of the organizations that operated in Neverwinter took on more prominent roles by 1479 DR.[58] As of 1491 DR, many of these factions still vied for control of the city.[52] Among the most important were:

- The Covenant, an order of wizards that operated out of Neverwinter during its earlier years.[28]
- The Many-Starred Cloak, an order of wizards that supported the rule of Lord Nasher Alagondar in the 1370s DR.[34]
- The Graycloaks militia that protected Neverwinter during the rule of Lord Nasher Alagondar.[18]
- A cell of the Harpers that operated in Neverwinter in the 1360s DR.[18]
- The New Neverwinter movement started by Lord Neverember in 1461 DR.[10]
- The Neverwinter Guard, the army of Neverwinter in the late years of the 15th century.[16]
- The Wintershield Watchmen, the police force of Neverwinter in the late years of the 15th century DR.[44][45]
- The dreaded Abolethic Sovereignty, which pulled the strings from behind the scenes since the eruption of Mount Hotenow.[31]
- The Ashmadai, who gained great renown in Neverwinter in the late 15th century.[11]
- A Thayan cell under Valindra Shadowmantle, operating in Neverwinter in the late 15th century to advance Szass Tam's agenda in the region.[59]
- The Dead Rats of Luskan, who had gained a foothold in Neverwinter in the late 15th century.[60]
- The Sons of Alagondar insurgent movement that opposed Neverember's rule,[61] but was mostly disbanded by 1491 DR.[33]
- A cell of Bregan D'aerthe, under the direct leadership of Jarlaxle Baenre himself.[62]
- A cell of the Order of the Gauntlet that became prominent in Neverwinter around 1491 DR.[36]
Before their utter defeat in the late 15th century,[33] a cell of Shadovar agents[63] and a tribe of orcs from Many-Arrows also operated in the city.[57]

# Trivia
- Neverwinter was the origin of the phrase "By the clocks of Neverwinter", used to swear something to be completely true and honest, declare something to be precise and accurate, or to complain something was needlessly perfectionist and pedantic. This was of course a reference to the precision of its timepieces.[1][4][18][64]
- The Neverwinter knife owed its name to the city.[18]
- Neverwinter's broadsheet was named Neverwinter Nights.[65]
