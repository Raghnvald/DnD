# Gunpowder (powder horn)
*Explosive*  


- **Cost**: 35 gp
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

Setting fire to a powder horn full of Gunpowder causes it to explode. When a powder horn explodes, each creature in a 10-foot-radius [Sphere](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on the powder horn makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
