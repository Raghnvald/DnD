# Orb of Direction
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/orb-of-direction.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This orb can be used as an Arcane Focus.

While holding this orb, you can take a [Magic](/3-Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to determine which way is magnetic north. Nothing happens if the orb is used in a location that has no magnetic north.
