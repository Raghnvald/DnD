# Potion of Poison
*Potion, minor, uncommon, poison*  

- **Properties**: Poison
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a [[Heiltrank]] or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An [[../Zauber/Identifizieren]] spell reveals its true nature.

If you drink it, you take `3d6` poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned). At the start of each of your turns while you are [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, you take `3d6` poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by `1d6`. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.
