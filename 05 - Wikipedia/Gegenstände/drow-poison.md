# Drow Poison
*Adventuring gear, poison (injury)*  


- **Properties**: [Poison](/3-Mechanics/CLI/item-properties.md#Poison)
- **Cost**: 200 gp

This poison is typically made only by the [drow](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/drow.md), and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also [unconscious](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Unconscious) while [poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
