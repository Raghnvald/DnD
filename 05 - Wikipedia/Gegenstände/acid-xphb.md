# Acid
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 25 gp
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

When you take the [Attack](/3-Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Attack) action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing a vial of Acid. Target one creature or object you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and [Proficiency Bonus](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md)) or take `2d6` Acid damage.
