Wand, common
This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a Magic action to expend 1 charge and create a harmless burst of multicolored light at a point you can see up to 120 feet away. The burst of light is accompanied by a crackling noise that can be heard up to 300 feet away. The light is as bright as a torch flame but lasts only a second.

Regaining Charges. The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand erupts in a harmless pyrotechnic display and is destroyed.
