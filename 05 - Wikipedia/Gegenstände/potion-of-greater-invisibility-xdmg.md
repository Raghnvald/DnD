# Potion of Greater Invisibility
*Potion, very rare*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/potion-of-greater-invisibility.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

This potion's container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink the potion, you have the [Invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Invisible) condition for 1 hour.
