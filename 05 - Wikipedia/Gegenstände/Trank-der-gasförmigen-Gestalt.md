# Potion of Gaseous Form
*Potion, minor, rare*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [gaseous form](../Zauber/Gasförmige-Gestalt.md) spell for 1 hour (no [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potion's container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.
