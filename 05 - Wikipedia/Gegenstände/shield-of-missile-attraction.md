# Shield of Missile Attraction
*Shield, major, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Properties**: Requires Attunement
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.

## Curse

This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the [remove curse](../Zauber/Fluch-brechen.md) spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
