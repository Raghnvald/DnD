# Boots of Elvenkind
*Wondrous item, major, uncommon*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/boots-of-elvenkind.webp#right)


While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/3-Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Stealth)) checks that rely on moving silently.
