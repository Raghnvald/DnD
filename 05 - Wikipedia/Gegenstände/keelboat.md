# Keelboat
*Ship, Vehicle (water)*  

- **Cost**: 3,000 gp
- **Weight**: ‚è§

Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores.
