# Thunderbuss
*Weapon (pistol), very rare*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/thunderbuss.webp#right)

- **Damage**: 1d10 piercing
- **Range**: 30/90
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

This magic ranged weapon is a flared pistol with the storm rune engraved along the barrel. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It requires no ammunition, its damage is thunder instead of piercing, and it doesn't have the loading property.

## Invoking the Rune

As a bonus action, you can invoke the weapon's rune to launch a ball of energy to a point you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The energy then detonates into a 10-foot-radius sphere of turbulent wind and thunder centered on that point, and each creature in that sphere must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `3d6` thunder damage, and it can't take reactions until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.
