# Ring of Evasion
*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ring-of-evasion.webp#right)


This ring has 3 charges, and it regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing the ring, you can take a [Reaction](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to expend 1 charge to succeed on that save instead.
