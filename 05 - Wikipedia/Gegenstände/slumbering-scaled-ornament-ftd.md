# Slumbering Scaled Ornament
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  



This ornament can be jewelry, a cloak, or another wearable accessory. It appears to be fashioned from a dragon's scale, tooth, or claw, or it incorporates images in those shapes.

You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid being [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) or [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened) or to end those conditions on you.
