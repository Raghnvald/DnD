# Necklace of Fireballs
*Wondrous Item, minor, rare*  

- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This necklace has `1d6 + 3` beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level [Feuerball](../Zauber/Feuerball.md) spell (save DC 15).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the [Feuerball](../Zauber/Feuerball.md) by 1 for each bead beyond the first.
