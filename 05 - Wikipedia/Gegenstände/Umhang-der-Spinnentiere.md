# Cloak of Arachnida
*Wondrous Item, major, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Requires Attunement
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with faint silvery threads. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:

- You have resistance to poison damage.  
- You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.  
- You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.  
- You can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were difficult terrain.  
- You can use an action to cast the [Spinnennetz](Spinnennetz.md) spell (save DC 13). The web created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this property of the cloak can't be used again until the next dawn.
