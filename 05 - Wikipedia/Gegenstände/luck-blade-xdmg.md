# Luck Blade
*Legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/luck-blade.webp#right)


You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the weapon is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.

## Luck

If the weapon is on your person, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one failed [D20 Test](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md) if you don't have the [Incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition. You must use the second roll. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Wish

The weapon has `1d3` charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge and cast [Wish](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish-xphb.md) from it. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. The weapon loses this property if it has no charges.
