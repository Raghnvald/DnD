# Adze of Annam
*Weapon (greataxe), artifact (requires attunement)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/adze-of-annam.webp#right)

- **Damage**: 1d12 slashing
- **Properties**: Heavy, Two-Handed
- **Weight**: 7.0 lbs.

This massive adze is said to have been wielded by All-Father Annam, not as a weapon but as the tool he used to shape the various worlds of the Material Plane eons ago.

## Random Properties

The adze has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the Dungeon Master's Guide:

- 2 minor beneficial properties  
- 1 major beneficial property  
- 2 minor detrimental properties  

## Magic Weapon

When a creature attunes to the adze, the artifact magically adjusts its size so that creature can wield it as a greataxe. The adze is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. On a hit, the adze deals an additional `3d12` force damage. It also deals double damage to objects and structures.

## Divine Mattock

As an action, you can call upon the might of the All-Father and use the adze to cast move earth or fabricate. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
